## Problem 
The knowledge industry has a diverse group of intellectual workforce and professionals from different backgrounds, all of them possessing a wide range of skill sets and abundant industry experience. One can learn a skill they lack, or teach a skill they possess, from/to others. The benefits of utilizing this non-profit “skill-sharing” opportunity is often overlooked. Having a free platform to utilize this opportunity can lead to more proficient and well-rounded individuals. This also leads to good employment opportunities. Such a platform, where the people teach or learn skills from each other which is free, is missing to the best of our knowledge.

## Solution 
SkillShare is a web platform where individuals come together as a community to help each other learn skills. These skills could range anywhere from learning programming languages, coding or learning a new tool - to - learning instruments like violin and guitar classes or learning yoga etc. People can register, login and create a profile with details such as name, contact details, skills they are willing to teach and skills they are looking for or interested to learn. They can create a session/class with title, timings and brief description on what is being offered in the class. The platform is capable of receiving requests and sending confirmation notifications and handling capacity constraints for each class as set by the tutor. All these classes can be viewed by the User on the dashboard of their profiles with different tabs for classes they are offering and the classes they are learning. The platform also offers its Users to talk about their learnings and to share their experiences through Twitter and Facebook social media integrations. This environment facilitates a mentorship between individuals.
